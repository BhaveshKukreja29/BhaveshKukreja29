I'm a backend developer who crafts systems and understanding how they work internally. I love reading and writing code.
I also do deep dives into CPython's source code and write about my findings:
* How Python lists use are dynamic: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/how-do-lists-really-work-in-python-4cmn)
* Explaining Python's dictionary structure and O(1) lookups: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/a-deep-dive-into-python-dictionaries-4758)

I'm a developer who crafts systems and spends time understanding how they work internally.

I also do deep dives into CPython's source code and write about it:
* List data structure: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/how-do-lists-really-work-in-python-4cmn)
* Dictionary data structure: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/a-deep-dive-into-python-dictionaries-4758)

Passionate about software craftsmanship and implementation details.

I'm a backend developer who enjoys building systems and understanding how they work at their core. I love writing code in Python. Here are some of my creations:

* **Rexus:** A high-performance API Gateway built with FastAPI, featuring caching and rate limiting with Redis. [GitHub](https://github.com/BhaveshKukreja29/Rexus)
* **King's Gambit:** A full-stack, real-time chess platform with a React frontend and Django backend, including WebRTC video chat. [GitHub](https://github.com/BhaveshKukreja29/KingsGambit)
* **PaperPal:** A CLI research assistant that uses the Gemini API for document summarization and Q&A. [GitHub](https://github.com/BhaveshKukreja29/PaperPal)
* **Shooter Game:** A simple enemy shooter game I made in C using Borland's graphics.h [GitHub](https://github.com/BhaveshKukreja29/shooter-game)


I also do deep dives into CPython's source code and write about my findings:

* How Python lists use a dynamic C array for performance: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/how-do-lists-really-work-in-python-4cmn)
* Explaining Python's dictionary structure and O(1) lookups: [Blog](https://dev.to/bhavesh_kukreja/a-deep-dive-into-python-dictionaries-4758)
